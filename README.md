# TripAdvisor.com Clone - HTML & CSS Project

GitHub Link:<a>https://nishaweb-developer.github.io/trip_advisor/</a>


Welcome to the TripAdvisor.com clone! This project is part of my HTML and CSS learning journey, where I aimed to replicate the design and layout of TripAdvisor's website using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.

## Features

- **Responsive Header**: The website has a dynamic, scroll-responsive header that changes its layout when the page is scrolled. This effect is achieved using **JavaScript** to detect the scroll event and update the header accordingly.
  
- **Layout**: The page layout is designed using the **Flexbox** model. I utilized nested flexbox containers for creating a structured, flexible design, ensuring that all sections of the page align perfectly.
  
- **CSS Styling**: Various CSS concepts were applied to style the project:
  - **Flexbox** for responsive layout design.
  - **CSS Transitions** to create smooth effects during hover and scroll interactions.
  - **Positioning** to ensure elements are placed correctly, especially in the header.
  - **Backgrounds**, **fonts**, and **colors** are carefully selected to mimic the original TripAdvisor interface.

- **JavaScript Functionality**:
  - I used **JavaScript** to dynamically update the header layout when the page is scrolled, changing the design and style to make the header more compact and user-friendly.

## Concepts Used

- **HTML5**:
  - Structuring web content with semantic elements like `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<section>`, `<footer>`.
  
- **CSS3**:
  - **Flexbox**: Used extensively for creating responsive and adaptable layouts.
  - **Transitions**: Smooth hover effects for buttons and links.
  - **Positioning**: Fixed and relative positioning for the header and other elements.
  - **Fonts and Colors**: Applied to resemble the original TripAdvisor design.
  
- **JavaScript**:
  - **Scroll Events**: JavaScript was used to detect scrolling and dynamically change the header layout and style when the user scrolls past a certain point.
